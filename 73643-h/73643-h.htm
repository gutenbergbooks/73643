<h3>
CAMBRIDGE
</h3>

<p>
To the sympathetic beholder one of the most
potent charms of England lies in the singular diversity
of its landscape.  To him each district makes its
special, its peculiar appeal.  He is sensible
everywhere of a real, if intangible, <i>genius loci</i>; and he
is prone to seek the effect of some such spirit as
well in the history of communities and bodies politic
as in the lives of individuals.  For him, then, there
must needs be something of truth in the idea that
much of the destinies of Oxford and Cambridge lay
written upon the land at their gates.  From the hills
above Oxford a man may see the whole city at his
feet.  Generations of men have so seen it, and have
so regarded it, subjectively&mdash;as a whole.  At sundown,
when the varied shape of tower and dome merge in
a common outline, this impression of unity becomes
unforgetably intensified; and but few, probably, of
those who have found there the place of their
education, will have left it without a sense of having
shared in some common purpose.  It has ever seemed
the aim of Oxford to foster uniformity; of Cambridge,
however unconsciously, to encourage the opposite in
thought and manners.  The sympathies which unite
men of a Cambridge education are not therefore less
strong, but they are subtler and less capable of
expression in a phrase.
</p>

<p>
Cambridge is no city of spires.  She lies belted
with woods in the midst of a wide plain.  To south, to
west, to east stretches a lowland landscape, delicately
moulded, rich in pasture and corn-bearing fields.
Northwards a man need ride but a few miles across
the fens to hear the bells of Ely, or at twilight to see
the lantern of that ancient church preserve its solitary
vision of the sun.  Through this broad tract of
country, whose every detail is typical of all which
is most beautiful in the Eastern Midlands, winds
that gentlest of English rivers, the Cam.  Above
Cambridge, it still bears its ancient name of Granta;
at Ely it is the Ouse.  The scenery along its upper
reaches, though small in scale, is of singular merit to
eyes which are not weary of "Nature's old felicities".
Near Grantchester, a lock now marks an ancient
bifurcation of the river, and here the stream widens
to form a deep sequestered pool, shaded by a veritable
arena of tall trees.  Poet as well as peasant
must often have bathed here and have made it a
place of meditation.  It was a favourite spot with
Byron, and it is still called after him.
</p>

<p>
Passing from the countryside to within the boundaries
of the University itself, nothing, perhaps, will
seem more remarkable to the curious observer than
the absence of that hard-featured grandeur with
which the architecture of the Middle Ages was so
deeply impressed.  Cambridge goes back eight
centuries; but there remains little to remind us of those
many vicissitudes of mediæval life from which neither
of the Universities emerged unscathed; for with the
disappearance of Feudalism, the advent of the New
Learning, and the breakdown of Monasticism,
Cambridge assumed a richer dress, and the fine apparel
of those days becomes her still.  From that string
of Tudor palaces whose broad lawns and well-nurtured
gardens mark the lazy passage of the Cam, to those
more distant Colleges of Jesus and Emmanuel, a grave
tranquillity pervades the whole.  This sense of peace
and of contentment, so precious to the individual
mind, seems largely due to that gracious domesticity
which the Tudor architect so well knew how to
impart even to the meanest of his college buildings.
But to those later architects who practised here,
while architecture was still an art in England, is
owing that conscious, studied stateliness we now prize.
The genius of Wren, which at Oxford in his tower of
Christ Church with inimitable propriety seized upon
and revivified for his purpose the Gothic style of
architecture, as easily and as properly adapted itself
to the more reticent temper of this University.  The
examples of his skill which may be seen at Pembroke
and Emmanuel; the bridge at St. John's, built by his
pupil Hawksmoor apparently from his designs; above
all his great Library at Trinity, remain to show with
what appreciation he met the contemplative character
of the Cambridge mind, with what zest he lent
his art to the commemoration of her material prosperity.
</p>

<p>
The first important period of building in Cambridge
was the fourteenth century.  Seven colleges
were founded and provided with decent accommodation
between 1324 and 1352.  In the next century
four more colleges were set up.  While in the
sixteenth century, from 1505 to 1595, another seven
colleges were added to the University.  Two other
colleges have since arisen in Cambridge&mdash;Downing,
built in 1805; and Selwyn, set up originally as a
hostel in 1882, but now recognized as a "House"
in all but the official sense of that expression.  There
are also two large and important colleges which are
devoted to the higher education of women.  Girton
College, founded in 1867, is the oldest institution
of its kind.  Newnham College dates from 1871.
That Cambridge should have been the first university
in England to admit women to her studies and
to her examinations is no more than fitting, when
it is remembered that some six of her principal
colleges were founded or endowed by great ladies.
Members of Clare, Pembroke, Queens', Christ's,
St. John's, and Sidney Sussex Colleges may, for this
reason, very properly feel a certain debt to the sex.
</p>

<p>
Still more remarkable is the extent of royal
benefaction in Cambridge.  In Oxford only one College,
Queen's, owes its existence directly to the patronage
of royalty.  At Cambridge there are five houses which
can lay claim to the style of a royal foundation: King's,
Trinity, Queens', Christ's, St. John's; and of these
the first two were founded and endowed by reigning
sovereigns.  King's Hall&mdash;afterwards merged in
Trinity&mdash;was planned by Edward II and endowed by
Edward III; King's College was founded by Henry
VI; and Trinity by Henry VIII, who further endowed
several professorships in the University; Queen
Margaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Woodville, Queen to
Edward IV, are co-founders of Queens'; Lady Margaret
Tudor was the foundress of Christ's and St. John's
Colleges.  But the patronage of England's
monarchs did not end with the sixteenth century.
Mary was a benefactor to Trinity.  Queen Elizabeth
attached Westminster School to that college by
certain scholarships, and sent timber to and completed
the chapel there.  She also sent building material
to Corpus Christi College.  James I was always
coming to Cambridge; but, like most of the Stuarts, did
little for the University, unless a copy of his
literary "works" be considered a benefaction.  George I
purchased the library of Bishop Moore of Ely and
gave it to the University.  He also founded the
regius professorship of Modern History there; while
George IV contributed to the building of what is now
called the New Court at Trinity College.  His brother,
the Duke of Gloucester, was the first member of an
English Royal family to be educated within the
precincts of a university.  He was of Trinity, where two
portraits of him now hang.  The House of Hanover
has ever shown favour to Cambridge.  Prince Albert,
Consort to Queen Victoria, was its Chancellor, and
his late Majesty King Edward VII, having himself
spent a year at each of the Universities, sent his
elder son, the late lamented Duke of Clarence, to
Cambridge, where he was entered at Trinity and by
his father's special command "kept" in college,
attended the usual lectures, and lived the ordinary life
of an undergraduate nobleman.  The latest member
of the Royal family to enter the University is Prince
Leopold of Battenberg, whose period of residence at
Magdalene College has only recently terminated.
</p>

<p>
It seems never easy to explain to people
unacquainted with English University life, the precise
difference between the University and the College.
The University, as a corporation teaching and
granting degrees, is older than any college, and has its
own endowments.  Now, however, that the colleges
have come and have established a social and
domestic tone which could not exist without them,
the University shows itself conscious of their value
in a great many ways.  The Vice-chancellor is
elected from the number of Heads of Houses; the
Proctors are nominated by each college in rotation,
and the University expects and has now the power
to exact contributions from each college towards the
necessary expenses of the whole academy.  Within
the colleges themselves there are three grades of
inmate: the Fellow, the Scholar, and the Pensioner.
The first must be of Bachelor standing at the time
of his election, and must shortly afterwards proceed
to a higher degree.  He draws his stipend from the
endowments of the college.  From this class are
drawn the college Tutors, Lecturers, and Deans, while
as many more "dons" devote their time to private
study.  The scholars on the foundation draw their
stipends from the endowments of the college in
accordance with the statutes or the terms of some
special benefaction; while the term Pensioner
comprises all those undergraduates who pay for
everything they receive at college.
</p>

<p>
But the history of the English Universities must
be considered as that of communities into whose
lives colleges were introduced for a social rather
than a scholastic purpose.  Cambridge grew into
a seat of learning during the latter half of the twelfth
century, but the first College, Peterhouse, was not
founded till 1284.  Till then, the scholars who resorted
to the place lodged where they could in the town.
This was the practice at every university in Europe;
and, even to-day, the Universities of Oxford,
Cambridge, and Dublin afford the only exceptions to it.

<p>
Housed in dwellings mean enough to the eye and
as certainly ungracious to the nose, the young scholars
of those early days lived a life of what we should now
call intolerable discomfort.  Coarse vesture, scanty food,
long hours in the "common schools", such were the
dominant features in the student life of every youth
who sought to acquire the book learning of his day.
Nor did the foundation of the first few colleges sensibly
alter these unhappy conditions.  The aim of their
founders was the removal by benefaction of some of
the worst hardships to which the young scholar was
then subjected.  Thus provision was made for the bare
necessaries of life&mdash;lodging, food, and raiment.  Poverty
was, of course, the first statutory qualification for
membership.  That the prosecution of certain studies
was enjoined upon the beneficiaries, testifies less to
a desire to further this or that branch of knowledge
than to a not unnatural anxiety lest these young
men should fall into idleness or other evil habits.
</p>

<p>
What was the town and what the university into
which this new element of scholastic life now entered?
Cambridge had a navigable river pouring its waters
into the North Sea at the natural port of Lynn.
Moreover, the town marked the junction of two Roman
roads.  It was a fertile spot; and its situation had
struck the Conqueror as one of strategic importance.
Here, therefore, he built a castle, the mound of which
remains to this day.  The structure itself was
dismantled gradually during the fifteenth century.  Some
of the stone was used for the building of King's
Hall, and some for King's College.  "Hereby", writes
Fuller in 1655, "that stately structure, anciently the
ornament of Cambridge, is at this day reduced next to
nothing."  But during the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries men might still look at that Norman keep and
take heart of grace.  Under its shadow had grown
up a prosperous market town.  On the one hand it
was the greatest Fish Mart, on the other a town
noted for one of the most important Fairs in the
country.  This Fair was held in a field hard by the
village of Barnwell, that is to say, within two miles
of the University town itself; it began on the feast
of St. Bartholomew and lasted until the fourteenth
day after the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross
(Aug.  24&mdash;Sept.  14).  It still survives as the principal
pleasure show and Horse Fair of the shire.
</p>

<p>
With these advantages Cambridge, as a town,
rose rapidly in importance.  The Jews appeared in
1106; and during that and the succeeding century
most of the religious orders had established
themselves in the place.  The Templars were the first
to appear.  They built their church sometime between
1120 and 1140.  It is the earliest of the four round
churches which have come down to us.
</p>

<p>
Our universities, like most other English institutions,
were not made&mdash;they grew; and all we can say
of the origin of Cambridge is, that before the
thirteenth century was far advanced references to it as a
"stadium generate" or University creep into the state
documents of the time.  A migration from Oxford took
place in 1209, and in 1231 a letter from King Henry III
to the Mayor and bailiffs makes mention of a great
influx of scholars "both from the regions near home
and from beyond the seas".  This document is also
interesting as showing that the finding of lodgings
was a matter of no little difficulty to the scholars.
The King has to request the townspeople to deal
properly with the students in all such transactions.
When, therefore, Walter de Merton, the founder of
the College in Oxford which bears his name, bought
land at both Universities and endowed students in
those schools, his benefaction came none too soon.
His house and scholars at Cambridge are mentioned
in a document as early as 1259; and it was not till
1274 that he removed these scholars to the other
University.  Ten years later was founded the first
exclusively Cambridge College.  It was to consist of a
Master and fourteen Fellows, together with a number
of "bible clerks"&mdash;young men whose duty it was to
read to the Society at meal times.  This College
was dedicated to St. Peter, and was known as "the
House of the scholars of St. Peter", or Peterhouse.
The founder was Hugh de Balsham, Bishop of Ely.
</p>

<p>
The reasons which dictated Merton's change of
policy can only be conjectured.  To attempt to set
up a stable society in an obviously unstable
community must have seemed to many a risky project.
A university was a body of students who possessed in
actual property little more than the gowns upon their
backs.  At a word of plague or rapine they could, and
indeed did, migrate elsewhere.  A college with buildings
and land could not as easily or as profitably
take flight.  From the point of view of a would-be
benefactor, Cambridge, standing as it did "on the
edge of the great wild"&mdash;to use Mr. J. W. Clark's
words&mdash;might well seem to possess a less favourable
situation than Oxford.  It had, in the past, suffered
a great deal from attack; and if the educationists
of those days thought twice before running the risk
of seeing their good works brought to nought in
Cambridge, the subsequent history of the University
very nearly bore out their worst fears; for the
revolting peasants who followed the celebrated Wat Tyler
entered Cambridge in considerable numbers, and, being
joined by the great mass of the townsfolk, broke into
Corpus Christi College.  They burnt its archives,
together with every other book and paper they could
lay their hands on; and not content with this damage
"done and committed", they repaired to St. Mary's
and the Common Schools, where, seizing the University
chests, they destroyed the muniments and made
away with the funds.

</p>

<p>
Thus it is neither surprising if Merton should have
felt doubtful of the continued prosperity of Cambridge,
nor remarkable that twenty-eight years should have
elapsed before Hugh de Balsham's venture in founding
a college there should have met with the flattery
of imitation.  But the next college, that of
Michaelhouse (merged afterwards, as was King's Hall, in
Henry VIII's great College of the Holy Trinity), was
followed in quick succession by five other foundations:&mdash;Clare
Hall, 1326; King's Hall, 1337; Pembroke Hall, 1347;
Gunvil Hall (now Gonville and Caius College), 1348;
Trinity Hall, 1350; and Corpus Christi College, 1352.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps a word concerning the nomenclature of
Cambridge Colleges may fittingly find a place here.
"College" is a late expression, as things go in
Cambridge.  The earliest words are <i>domus</i> and
<i>aula</i>, respectively "house" and "hall": thus Peterhouse,
Michaelhouse, and God's House (now Christ's
College); and Clare Hall, Pembroke Hall, and Catharine
Hall.  This use of the word "hall" is ancient and
honourable in Cambridge, and the fact that it has
a different signification in Oxford, where it is used
to denote a licensed lodging-house under a Master
of Arts, should never have operated to prevent its
retention in our University to-day.  "The Hall of
the Holy Trinity of Norwich" is perhaps forced
by circumstance to preserve its ancient name; but
when it calls itself "<i>The</i> Hall", it does so, one
must hope, rather as a protest than in pride of
singularity.  Some popular errors or misapprehensions
may here be noted under this head.  The college
styled in the Cambridge Calendar "Gonville and
Caius" was originally founded by one Edmund
Gonville, who pronounced his name "Gunvil".  It was
later re-endowed and much enlarged by the
celebrated Dr. Keys, who, conformable to the fashion
of his day, latinized his name for literary purposes
into "Caius".  The latinized form of the one and
the more correct spelling of the other founder are
now used in writing down the name of the College;
but, colloquially, traditional usage still preserves the
English names in the pronunciation of their time.
The members of Queens' College, in virtue of two royal
foundresses, write the apostrophe after the final "s";
while Magdalene men insist on preserving the final
"e" in the name of their patron saint.  Perhaps,
however, the most curious example of a wrong
name clinging to a House is presented by Jesus
College.  This, the popular appellation, is no better
than a nickname.  The college is not dedicated to
Our Saviour, but to "The Blessed Virgin Mary,
St. John the Evangelist, and the Glorious Virgin
St. Rhadigund".  It happens to stand in the now
obliterated and forgotten parish of Jesus; but this
nickname from a past age continues to serve its old and
useful purpose.  Another example is that of Pembroke
College, founded by Marie, widow of Aylmer
de Valence, Earl of Pembroke.  The foundress wished
her college to be styled "The Hall of Valence Marie",
and such is its proper name.  Lastly, King's College
was dedicated to St. Mary and St. Nicholas.

Before turning to the more modern aspect of
Cambridge, the subject demands that something should
be said of those notable periods of prosperity, the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  The evidence of
the growth and power of the University during those
years lies, for the visitor, in the number and
magnificence of the buildings then undertaken which have
survived till our own day the dual tests of time and
taste.  Of the original buildings of those early
colleges to which reference has already been made
next to nothing remains.  The shell of the old court
at Corpus is still standing; but this part of the college
has been re-roofed, most of the windows in it are
of a late period, and it is almost wholly covered with
ivy.  Some of the masonry forming the south wall
of the Peterhouse kitchen is perhaps as old as
anything in Cambridge; and this quaint corner of
the oldest college is the subject of an illustration
to the present volume.  The Chapel of this college
is of the seventeenth century.  The Library is late
Tudor.  The Hall and Combination Room are part
restorations and part a matter of fresh designing.
The work was undertaken between 1866-70.  Gilbert
Scott, William Morris, Burne-Jones, and Ford Madox
Brown had each a hand in it.  Trinity Hall has been
almost entirely rebuilt.  All save the Library, which
is late Tudor and which lies beyond the main
quadrangle, is of late eighteenth-century design.  The
lodge and certain newer buildings are said to be
commodious.  They are none the less ugly.  The
rebuilding of Clare Hall began during the reign
of Charles I and was continued during the interregnum;
but it was not finished until the eighteenth
century had entered upon the last quarter of its
course.  As it stands to-day, it is perhaps the most
perfect example of the Carolian style in England.
The little bow window over the gateway is remembered
as the favourite seat of a certain fellow of the
College, who lived and died more than a hundred
years ago, and of whom it is recorded that, being at
feud with the Master of his College, he chose this
particular set of chambers, because of the chance it
afforded him of successfully spitting at that unlucky
dignitary as he entered or left the college precincts.

Pembroke College possessed till quite recently a
really beautiful example of a fourteenth-century
Dining-hall.  The late Mr. Waterhouse alarmed the
society by reporting it to be in danger of falling
about their ears.  He was commissioned, therefore,
to take it down and to build them another.  In
executing the first part of these instructions he was
observed to have recourse to dynamite.  Less drastic
methods might avail to remove the building which
now occupies the place of that fine old Hall.  In
speaking of it the present writer is tempted to
borrow the words of the learned Provost of King's
in noticing the Library building by the same hand:
"It could only suffer", says Dr. James, "by any
description of it that I might write".  Gonville Hall was
another college destined to undergo a complete
remodelling.  Fortunately the rebuilding took place
in the sixteenth century, and much of the work then
undertaken remains to this day.  It marked the munificence
of its re-founder, and devoted master, the celebrated
Dr. Caius.  This extraordinary man was born in
Norwich in 1510.  He was of Gonville Hall, and, after
taking the usual degrees, proceeded Doctor at Padua,
where he lectured in Greek.  His learning was
prodigious and his reputation European.  He lived
to translate some Erasmus into English, to write
numerous treatises of his own, to preside over the
College of Physicians, to carry out various antiquarian
researches, and to serve with distinction as
Physician to Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth.  He
ended his days Master of his beloved College in
Cambridge, where he lies buried.  In his last illness
he endeavoured to sustain life by a return to the
natural nourishment of infancy; and divers dames
of the town were privileged to minister to his wants
in this respect.  Being observed to be now "froward,
peevish, and full of frets", and now tractable, docile,
and of an amiable countenance, his moods and tempers
were considered to vary with the individual source
of his curious refreshment.  Gonville and Caius College,
as it is now called, possessed till recently three
gateways of the time of Caius.  That leading on to the
street was inscribed the Gate of Humility; that
between the first and second court, the Gate of Virtue;
and the last, as leading to the hall where degrees
were conferred, the Gate of Honour.  Of these gates
the two last mentioned have fortunately survived;
but the first has given place to a large block of
buildings designed by the late Mr. Waterhouse in
his best Provincial Assurance manner.  The visitor
will be startled to read the words <i>Porta Humilitatis</i>
above the doorway of this amazing pile.
</p>

<p>
The fifteenth century saw four more Colleges added
to the list of Cambridge Houses: King's, 1441; Queens',
1448; St. Catharine's, 1473; Jesus, 1495.  The first of
these was designed to eclipse every other collegiate
foundation in England.  As finally settled by the
will of Henry VI, its founder, the society consisted
of seventy souls under the headship of a Provost.
It is bound by sisterly ties to King Henry's other
foundation, the College of St. Mary at Eton.  Eton,
indeed, was and is to King's College what Winchester
has been to New College in Oxford.  Till 1857 the
scholars of Eton proceeded by right to scholarships
and fellowships at King's.  None but Etonians could
come upon the foundation, and Kingsmen enjoyed the
further privilege of proceeding to their degrees
without any University examination.  The Society ceded
these privileges in the year named, and by its present
statutes consists of a Provost, forty-six Fellows,
forty-eight Scholars, of whom twenty-four hold "close"
scholarships attached to Eton, two Chaplains, an
Organist, and a Master of the Boys.  The choristers
on the foundation are required to be of gentle birth,
and they have their education in an admirably equipped
school under the special government of the College.  Of
the buildings which the founder not only contemplated
but specified in a document drawn up by himself,
nothing but the Chapel was so much as set out.  The
Gatehouse, the great Quadrangle, the Hall and Butteries,
the Library, the Provost's Lodging, the Cloister
with its garth, the Bell Tower, and the bridge across
the river were planned and specified, but never
undertaken on the lines which the founder so carefully laid
down.  The King died before he could sufficiently
endow his college.  His immediate successors in the
Crown of England, to whom in language unforgetably
solemn he commended the care of his foundation, did
something for it; but egotism being stronger than
piety in princes, those royalties of a later age who
cared to patronize learning preferred to initiate rather
than complete.  The Chapel of King's College,
however, owes a great deal to the munificence of the
Sovereigns of England.  It took more than a
century in building, and cost for the stonework alone
about £160,000, according to the present value of
money.  To the completion of this magnificent
structure Edward IV, Richard III, Henry VII, Henry VIII,
and Queen Elizabeth subscribed on a liberal scale.
The window glass and the woodwork belong wholly to
the sixteenth century, with here and there additions
of a later date.  The roof, had it been carried out
by the first set of masons employed, would certainly
have been "lierne" vaulted; but by the time the walls
were ready to bear a roof at all, "fan" vaulting had
come into vogue.  The Chapel as it stands to-day
presents without doubt one of the most beautiful
interiors to be seen in England.  The choir-screen
and stalls are of Renaissance design, executed with a
subtlety not to be matched on this side of the Alps.
The Lectern is of the first quarter of the sixteenth
century and is therefore nearly contemporaneous with
the greater number of the stained-glass windows.
In one of the side chapels is preserved an interesting
specimen of a fifteenth-century pulpit, which on March
25 of every year, being the Annunciation of the
Virgin, is brought forth into the church.  From this
pulpit a Fellow of the College preaches before the
University on the day named: a departure from the
usual custom of meeting in Great St. Mary's which
serves to mark the founder's wish that his college
should occupy a pre-eminent place in Cambridge.
</p>

<p>
The sixteenth century saw the foundation and
endowment of the two great colleges of Trinity and
St. John's, the sister college to the latter, Christ's,
and the rise of Magdalene, Emmanuel, and Sidney
Sussex.  Of these, St. John's was the first to attain
eminence.  Bishop Fisher, Cecil the great Lord
Burleigh, and Archbishop Williams successively lent her
their aid.  She became <i>par excellence</i> an aristocratic
college, and by the first decade of the nineteenth
century could boast that she included among her
alumni more men of note in the social and intellectual
life of the country than any other college in
either University could lay claim to.  The first Court
of this College has been much disturbed.  The gateway
is one of the finest examples of its period to
be found anywhere; but, on entering the College,
the eye is at once offended by a poor eighteenth-century
range of buildings on the left, and a vast
effort by the late Sir Gilbert Scott, by way of Chapel,
on the right.  The second Court, however, is well-nigh
faultless.  Here is late Tudor at its best; and
in this small rosy-red brick of the period it finds the
happiest material for the expression of its aims.
The further or third Court is Carolian.  It is quaint
and charming in its own rather odd fashion, and
as seen from the river, whose waters here touch
the very walls of its western range, contrives to
bear a strangely impressive appearance.  The Cam
is here spanned by two bridges: one, a very beautiful
example of Sir Christopher Wren's style&mdash;it was
built by his pupil Hawksmoor&mdash;the other a Cockney
Gothic affair commonly called "The Bridge of
Sighs".  This last connects the old Carolian building
with a huge range built during the years 1827-31,
which cost the college £78,000.  Of the bridge itself,
which is part of this dreadful building, it will be
noticed that a certain decency of proportion&mdash;its
one merit&mdash;renders it some degrees less detestable
than the main structure to which it belongs.
</p>

<p>
Christ's College, the other "Lady Margaret"
foundation, has undergone a great deal of rebuilding and
not a few additions.  The gateway from the street
and most of the chambers to right and left of
it are of the sixteenth century.  The finest
architectural possession of the college is its block of
Fellows' buildings towards the garden.  It would
seem to be by a pupil of Inigo Jones, if not actually
by the Master himself.
</p>

<p>
Magdalene is the only college in Cambridge which,
in a sense, is of monkish origin.  It was originally
a cell of Croyland; and being endowed by Henry,
second Duke of Buckingham, it soon came to be
known as Buckingham College.  In 1483 it is styled
"Bokyngham College" and its inmates are described
as "monachi".  Lord Chancellor Audley, who changed
the foundation into Magdalene College, refounded it
for an ordinary academical society, after the house,
as a cell of Croyland Abbey, had escheated to the
Crown.  This college does not elect its Master: the
headship of the House being in the gift of the
"owner of Audley End".  At present, therefore, the
Lords Braybrooke present to the Mastership.
Magdalene is a picturesque and commodiously arranged
college, and, though small, has many attractive
features.  The most interesting building is that erected
in the seventeenth century, primarily with the idea
of providing suitable accommodation for the library
of Samuel Pepys the diarist.  The latest addition,
a range brought close to the riverside, is perhaps
the most successful in design and colour of any of
the more recent buildings in the University.
</p>

<p>
The College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
though inheriting much from the earlier college&mdash;King's
Hall&mdash;which was set up by Edward II and
his son Edward III, owes almost everything to King
Henry VIII.  It was typical of this monarch that,
after somewhat maltreating Wolsey's foundation at
Oxford and paying not too much attention to Henry
VI's or King's College at Cambridge, he should have
set about founding Trinity with the plain intent of
eclipsing both.  The College as we see it to-day, is
the largest and wealthiest in either University.  It
is founded for a Master, sixty Fellows at the least,
and eighty Scholars.  In full term the resident members
number nearly eight hundred souls.  From the first,
the buildings were set out to accommodate an
unusually large society.  The Great Court, with its
Chapel, Gatehouse, Hall, Master's Lodge, and rows
of chambers, broken here by a tower, there by a turret,
occupies over two acres of ground.  The character
of its architecture is for the most part Tudor; for
the restorations and alterations which have from
time to time taken place have not been permitted
to stray far from the traditional style of the Court.
A further court&mdash;the Cloister or Neville's Court&mdash;consists
of two ranges of Jacobean design, modified by later
hands so as to fare better than they otherwise would
beside Sir Christopher Wren's great Library building,
which here occupies the entire western side of the
quadrangle, even projecting above and beyond it on
either side.  In addition to these two spacious courts
there are three other quadrangles, all of recent date.
These are fortunately so situated that the sightseer
can easily avoid looking at them.

Emmanuel College possesses one court of the
founder's time, and beautiful it is.  It is rarely
shown to the ordinary visitor, but those who care
for simple unpretending work of this period (1584)
have only to ask for the dovecot garden.  The main
Court of the College is of the seventeenth and
eighteenth century.  Wren made the design for the
Chapel, which was built between 1668-78.  The Court
is finely proportioned and has always been admired.

Sidney Sussex College, the last college to belong
to the sixteenth century, has been harshly dealt with.
A charming Elizabethan college has been ruthlessly
turned into a thoroughly bad stucco dwelling gothicized
in the Wyatt manner.  It has its treasures: a fine
garden, good pictures, and some handsome plate.

We have now traced the main periods of Cambridge
building.  We have said very little of the life
of the University or the growth of the town during
these four hundred years.  It is, indeed, hard to
contemplate the visible memorials of those days without
imagining a social life grander and happier for the
individual man than could ever have been the case.
Almost everything which makes for the amenities of
college life as we see it to-day is comparatively
speaking modern.  To picture the life of scholars young
and old even so late as the sixteenth century, we
must be prepared to learn strange things.  Fireplaces
were few and far between.  Folk gathered as much
as possible in the Common Hall of the College.  Here
was set a brazier of charcoal, its fumes poisonous and
disagreeable finding their way through a lantern or
louvre in the roof.  Rushes were upon the floor, if
it were not tiled or paved.  Windows having glass
in them were not common before the fifteenth
century.  The sanitary arrangements were primitive,
ill-managed, and consequently wretched.  Street lighting
was unknown.  Scholars slept two and often more
in a bed; and went, as did everyone else, naked to
their beds.  The advantages of a bedfellow in those
bitter winters were obvious.  It was equally obvious
that those who shared a chamber, and so often a bed,
should be well suited to one another; and parents
expressed a not unnatural anxiety on this head.
Letters exist in which the Tutor, who usually
occupied a bed apart in a chamber for five persons, of
whom four would be his pupils, is asked to choose
carefully a bedfellow "gentle and virtuous" for the
youthful freshman.  The average age of entering was
about fourteen during the earlier periods, but rose to
sixteen during the latter centuries of which we have
been writing.  Most college offences were punishable
by whipping, graver imprudences meeting with public
chastisement executed by a menial in the Common
Hall of the College.  Fellows of M.A. standing could
be put in the college "stocks", and often were so
handled.  The pedagogic notion that intellectual
advancement is furthered by the application of physical
pain was not confined to the grammar schools, and
parents were often eager to place their sons under
the care of a strong-armed college tutor.  "Prey
Grenefield", wrote a certain lady to a Cambridge
Tutor in the time of Henry VI, "to send me faithfully
worde ho Clemit Paston hathe do his dever i'
lernyng, and if he hathe nought do well nor wyll
nought amende, prey him that he wyll trewly belash
him tyll he wyll amend, and so did ye last maystr
and ye best en he had att Caumbreg."  As time went
on, however, the life of the ordinary pensioner
became comfortable enough; but, unhappily, the scholar
on the Foundation and the Sizar, or poorest of the
juniors, one who paid for his education by the
performance of menial offices, remained objects of
contempt with the more wealthy undergraduates.  Before
the end of the fifteenth century, pensioners "in Fellows'
Commons" had made their appearance in Cambridge.
They were allowed to dine with the Fellows at
the High Table, wore richly embroidered gowns
and enjoyed many other privileges and distinctions.
A higher order still was that of persons who entered
as "Noblemen".  Many of the latter class lived in
College and "kept" there in some state.  For example,
in 1624 Lord Maltravers and his brother William
Howard, sons of the then Earl of Arundel and Surrey,
came up to St. John's College with a retinue of
servants.  It was requested that the brothers might
occupy one room "with a pallett for the groome of
their chamber"; while "the rest of his lordship's
company, being two gentlemen, a groome of the
stable, and a footman, might be lodged in the town
near the College".

But the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, for all
the patronage of learning affected by prince and peer
alike, were troublous times for the scholar.  Much
wit was needed to guide him through those political
and religious conflicts which at times threatened
to bring the University to dissolution.  Doctors and
Masters were for ever being ousted, driven overseas,
or thrown into prison.  No man knew when he might
not be called upon to exchange a deanery for
a dungeon.  Let one example suffice.  On the death
of Edward VI, Lady Jane Grey was at once
proclaimed Queen by order of Northumberland.  On
16 July the Lady Mary was but five miles from
Cambridge, at the house of Sir Robert Huddlestone.
There she heard Mass and pushed on into Suffolk,
where she met her supporters.  The Duke of
Northumberland with his army arrived in Cambridge
five days later.  He was Chancellor of the University
and a man zealous in promoting its prosperity.  How
far the residents believed in his cause we know not;
but there seemed little apprehension of the fate which
in reality awaited him.  The Vice-Chancellor and many
of the Heads supped with him that night, and on
the morrow he set off for Bury.  His return was
speedy.  And here in the Market-place, bereft of his
former supporters, he was obliged, in the presence of
the Mayor, Vice-Chancellor, and the rest of the
Cambridge notables, to proclaim Mary Queen.  He then
repaired in some state to King's College, where, at
a late hour that night, he was arrested by one Roger
Slegge, the sergeant-at-arms, who was permitted to
enter the gates unmolested, though, as Fuller says,
"that College was fenced with more privileges than
any other foundation in the University".
</p>

<p>
The Popish reaction burst out at Cambridge with
almost incredible swiftness.  On a certain day "Doctor
Sandys, the Vice-Chancellor, on the ringing of the
Schools' bell, went according to his custom and office,
attended with the Bedells into the Regent House
and sat down in the chair according to his place.
In cometh one Master Mitch with a rabble of some
twenty Papists, some endeavouring to pluck him from
the chair, others the chair from him, all using railling
words and violent actions.  The Doctor, being a man
of mettle, groped for his dagger and probably had
despatched some of them had not Dr. Bill and
Dr. Blyth by their prayers and entreaties persuaded him
to patience."  He was, in due course, despoiled,
deprived, and cast into prison.  But there were other
losses which the University was called upon to
suffer during these two hundred years: direct loss of
treasure, and damage to those fair fabrics which the
piety of benefactors had bestowed upon the community.
Association of ideas is strong, and the Reformers were
probably justified by circumstances in most of their
destructive operations.  Yet the finer spirits must have
felt keenly the demolition of many objects irreplaceable
by the hand of man.  Good Dr. Caius kept what
he dared of Mass books, vestments, and antique church
ornaments, and seems to have hidden them away; but
they were discovered and destroyed; and probably
nothing but the degree of eminence to which he had
then attained as a physician saved him from sharing
the fate of his treasures.  As for the Puritans under
Cromwell, they did less damage than they might have
done.  King's College Chapel, the glory of the
University, they wholly spared; and the various Colleges
were called upon for less tribute than the experiences
of other corporations and the rough usage of those
times might have prepared their inhabitants to expect.
</p>

<p>
During the early part of the reign of Charles I
"the University", says Fuller, "began to be much
beautified in buildings, every College either shedding
its skin with the snake, or renewing its bill with the
eagle, having their courts or at leastwise their fronts
and gatehouses repaired and adorned.  But the
greatest alterations were in their chapels, most of
them being graced with the accession of organs."  Many
of the chapel ornaments were subsequently
defaced by Cromwell; but, as has already been stated,
King's was left untouched in the matter of its fabric,
its glass, and its brasses.  The elaborate tombs in
Caius Chapel were not injured; and the much earlier
tomb&mdash;that of Hugh Ashton&mdash;in St. John's was also
left undisturbed.  The Fellows of Peterhouse took
the precaution to bury the glass which filled the
east window of their chapel.  It lay undiscovered,
and all of it has now been replaced.  Certainly
Cromwell got some plate out of the University, but
this tribute was as nothing when compared to that
which went to Charles.  Trinity sent practically its
all.  King's, as the earlier Royal Foundation, could
not afford to be behindhand.  St. John's was Tory
almost to a man, and away went most of her finest
silver.  "Her contribution", says the present Master,
"was £150 in money and 2065 ounces, grocer's weight,
of silver plate."  Among the pieces so lost were
some bearing the names of Thomas Wentworth, Lord
Strafford, and of Thomas Fairfax.  For this the College
later suffered much indignity.  Cromwell surrounded
the place, took the Master a prisoner, and "confiscated
the communion plate and other valuables".  Nearly
every College had paid tribute; but the fact that
Cambridge was providentially spared the duty of nursing,
either then or afterwards, any part of a Stuart Court,
enabled her to save for posterity as much in gold
and silver works of handicraft as Oxford lost.  Thus
the Cambridge plate as it stands to-day is the finest
collection of its kind in existence.

Throughout these two hundred years&mdash;years of
Renaissance, of Reformation, of Revival, of
Revolution&mdash;Cambridge poured forth an unending stream of
men destined for the highest places in church, in
state, in scholarship, and in letters.  Coverdale, Fox,
Ridley, Latimer, Cranmer, Gardiner, Parker, Grindal,
Whitgift, Bancroft, Andrews, Cosin, Williams, Taylor,
Stillingfleet, Sancroft, Tillotson, Tenison are her
divines; and of the seven "nonjuring" bishops, five,
including the Primate, were Cambridge men.  The
Protector Somerset, Cecil the great Lord Burleigh,
his kinsman of Salisbury, Walsingham, Essex, Fulke
Greville, Sir John Harrington, Chief Justice Coke,
Sir Nicholas Bacon and his son Francis, Lord
Verulam (commonly but wrongly styled Lord Bacon),
Sir William Temple, Oliver Cromwell are figures
which are painted large upon the canvas of history;
and in a dark corner are inscribed the names, at
once famous and infamous, of Judge Jeffreys and
Titus Gates.  The lists of Cambridge scholars, poets,
and prose writers of this age is no less remarkable.
Roger Ascham, Sir John Cheke, Sir Thomas Smith,
Jeremy Taylor, Thomas Fuller; the poets Spenser,
Harvey, Marlowe, Greene, Fletcher, Ben Jonson,
Heywood, Andrew Marvell, Milton, Cowley, Donne, Dryden,
Herbert, Herrick, are names likely to live so long as
the English language be spoken.  Among Cambridge
antiquaries we find the names of Stowe, Leland, and
Strype.  In medicine Cambridge was the foremost
English school, and the names of Caius, Butler, Gilbert,
and Harvey have a permanent place in the history
of that Faculty.  Three celebrated men of
letters&mdash;Shirley, Lodge, and Lilley&mdash;migrated from Oxford
to Cambridge.  Wolsey, when he founded in Oxford
his Cardinal's College&mdash;now styled Christ
Church&mdash;came to King's College and King's Hall in
Cambridge for many of his first Fellows.  A Cambridge
College, Pembroke, gave no fewer than four Heads
to Oxford Houses during the latter half of the
sixteenth century; and of this same College was Bishop
Fox, the founder of Corpus Christi College in Oxford,
and of two professorships there.  In the New World,
with the names of "the Pilgrim Fathers", are
remembered those of Hooker of Peterhouse, of Eliot
the "Indian Apostle" who took his degree in 1622,
and of John Harvard of Emmanuel, the founder of
America's oldest House of Learning.  Horrocks and
Flamsteed, the astronomers, founded a Cambridge
School of Astronomy which has since taken the
foremost place in the development of that science.
</p>

<p>
The Cambridge of our own day contains much that
is reminiscent of those two hundred years.  During the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries academical dress
settled itself into the form in which for the most we
now see it.  But something has come down to us
of even earlier days.  Cambridge is not unjustly
proud of the fact that, unlike Oxford, the shape of its
hood has remained practically unaltered since the
fourteenth century.  A notable mediæval garment still
worn at Cambridge, and not elsewhere to be found,
is the <i>Cappa Clausa</i> or "closed cope", used by the
Vice-Chancellor and by certain Doctors of Divinity,
Law, and Physic on special occasions.  It is of scarlet
cloth with an ermine hood and trimmings.  It must
not be confused with the scarlet gowns worn by all
doctors in the several Faculties on gala days.  Over
the gate of Queens' College the curious may see a
rude representation of a doctor so robed; but a really
fine example of this dress as worn in the sixteenth
century may be seen on the brass to the memory of
John Argentein, D.D., M.D. (1507), in King's College
Chapel.  It was during the sixteenth century that
the present style of M.A. gown and that of the Law
gowns worn at Cambridge by Doctors of Laws and
in the Courts by King's Counsel came into use.  The
style is fundamentally that of the ordinary walking
dress of a notable of the end of the fifteenth century.
A robe of this kind, as an over-garment, obtained all
over Europe during the succeeding hundred years,
and it would appear to have been Italian in origin.
An example of the academical form of this garment
may be seen on a brass at Croxton in Cambridgeshire,
where is represented the figure of one Edward
Leeds, LL.D., a Master of Clare Hall, who died in
1589.  The strings now worn on all Cambridge gowns
would seem to have come into general use about
this time.  In early times gowns were "closed"
garments, and were put on over the head; and
after it became lawful to wear them open in front,
strings were used to tie the gown across the breast,
and they were so worn until quite recently.  Three
other survivals of the costume of this later period
may be noted.  They are all peculiar to Cambridge.
For example, the Proctor assumes on certain occasions
an upper garment called a "ruff".  Over this he
wears his hood in the ordinary way.  On certain
other occasions, however, he must wear his hood
"squared", that is, so folded that it presents the
appearance of a large square cape.  The method of
arranging this dress has been handed down, as has
a pattern "ruff", from Proctor to Proctor; but
nowadays the repositories of such traditions are more
often the Proctors' men, who, in these matters,
perform the offices which judges expect of their clerks.
The full dress of a Proctor's man&mdash;or "bull dog", as
he is vulgarly called&mdash;is picturesque enough, for it
is of a seventeenth-century pattern and consists in a
long blue cloak studded with brass buttons.  With
this he carries a halberd.  The Chancellor or
Vice-Chancellor in procession is always preceded by two
graduates, of M.A. standing at least, who are styled
Esquire Bedells.  The maces which these gentlemen
carry on such occasions were given by George Villiers,
Duke of Buckingham, the favourite of James I.  The
Duke was elected Chancellor of the University by
the narrow majority of five votes.  Another old
custom, full of associations for Cambridge men, is the
ringing of Curfew at Great St. Mary's Church.  The
University bell rings the Curfew nightly from nine
of the clock till ten minutes past the hour.  The
date of the month is also struck by one of the
same peal of bells.  More curious, however, is the
fact that the service, or, more properly speaking,
the "office" of Compline, is commemorated at Trinity
Hall by the ringing of a bell there nightly at ten
o'clock.
</p>

<p>
Many echoes of those "Disputations" which in
mediæval times took the place of examinations may
be followed in the Cambridge of to-day.  The office
of "Moderator" is with us still; Junior and Senior
"Sophisters" are those who are on the road to
becoming "Questionists"; and "Wranglers" are those
who issue with honours from the supposed contest.
A person qualifying for a medical degree when
reading or submitting his finished "Thesis" is said to
"Keep an Act" (i.e. a Disputation) for that degree.
The origin of the word Tripos is not yet settled.
Perhaps it derived itself from some sort of stool.
Anyhow, by the middle of the eighteenth century,
the Tripos had come to mean a sheet of paper upon
one side of which were printed the names of those
who had attained Honours in the Mathematical School,
whilst upon the other was a copy of Latin Verses.
Sheets of this Tripos paper were thrown by the
Moderators from the gallery of the Senate House
into the crowd assembled below.  But until this
same century was some way advanced another set
of verses, usually very scurrilous in character, were
recited by a sort of University Buffoon, who came
also to be called "The Tripos".  Licensed revellers
were well-known institutions in both Universities
throughout the Middle Age; but it was not until this
Tripos fellow had been the subject of many scandals,
protests, and warnings, that he was finally abolished.
</p>

<p>
The history of the English Universities in the
eighteenth century has yet to be written; and though
much material for such a history is accessible to the
humblest enquirer, it is not possible in so short an
essay as the present to do more than touch&mdash;and
that very lightly&mdash;upon the salient features of
Cambridge life during this, perhaps the most diverting
period of the University's existence.
</p>

<p>
It is still fashionable to believe the Church and
both the Universities to have passed the whole of
these hundred years in a species of post-prandial
slumber.  Colleges are said to have become mere
port-drinking societies; and the daily life of the
Cathedral Chapters has been described quite as tersely and
as disobligingly by numerous writers.  Truly, the
manners of the time were not over nice; but the
impartial student of morals can well trace throughout the
century a steady, if slow, revival from that dire sort
of profligacy which marked the social life of the
Stuart period.  For the first time since the age
of the Tudors, English architecture and the other
arts not only revived, but attained the dignity of a
conscious and coherent style.  Gainsborough, Romney,
Reynolds took the place once filled by such as Lely.
Wren, Hawksmoor, Vanbrugh, Adam gave to many
an English building a fame which has not been confined
to these islands.  An intelligent taste in
furniture, plate, porcelain, and fabrics became almost
general in decent society.  Music was widely cultivated,
and literary effusions which did not conform,
however dully, to the accepted models of the day
found neither publisher nor reader.
</p>

<p>
Every merit and, it must be admitted, every
demerit of the age is observable in the life of the
University during these hundred years.  Certainly
there was a prodigious decay in University
ceremonial, and the antiquaries shook their heads not
perhaps without reason.  Poor Hearne, noting the
first Shrove-Tuesday morning on which the ancient
"Pancake bell" did not ring in Oxford, ventured
upon the aphorism: "When laudable old customs
alter, 'tis a sign learning dwindles".  Baker, Cole, and
Gunning at Cambridge were doomed to see many
cherished quaintnesses pass from the daily life of the
academy.  The ceremonies attending the Creation of
Doctors in the several Faculties were gradually shorn
of their symbolic splendour.  These had involved in
each case the use of a Ring and a Book.  A candidate
for a Doctorate in Law might be seen at such times
to engage in a whispered colloquy with the Professor
of his Faculty.  This, perhaps the most picturesque
and most formal part of the ceremony of Creation,
was known as "solving a question in the ear
of the Professor".  Good Master Gunning could not
have failed to take pleasure in the circumstances
which attended the University Sermon on Tuesday
in Holy-week.  On this day the sermon was preached,
not in Great St. Mary's, but in the Anglo-Saxon
Church of St. Benet.  Before the sermon the preacher
was directed to say: "John Meer, Esquire Bedell, long
since of this University, gave a tenement situate in
this parish; in consideration whereof the sermon is
here this day.  He left a small remembrance to the
officers of this University provided they were present
at the Commemoration; and was also not unmindful
of the poor in the Tolbooth and Spittal-house."  At
the conclusion of the sermon a distribution was made
of this "small remembrance".  It worked out at three
shillings and fourpence for the preacher, sixpence
for the Vice-Chancellor, and fourpence each for the
other dignitaries.  A disbursement of three shillings
covered the other part of this amiable bequest!

<p>
During the whole of this period the University exercised
its ancient right of supervising all weights and
measures.  Officers known as Taxors performed the
necessary testing, and at such times were authorized
to destroy any faulty measures which came under
their observation.  There existed, too, for the
punishment of disorderly women, a University prison or
bridewell called "the Spinning House", and one of the
duties of the Proctors consisted in the visitation and
inspection of any quarter of the town or its
immediate environs in which vice was reputed to lurk.
The Spinning House existed, as a building, within
the recollection of the writer.  It stood on ground
now occupied by the Fire Station in Regent Street.
These particular jurisdictions and the fact that the
Vice-Chancellor took precedence of the Mayor at all
public functions constituted the chief ground for that
ill feeling between Town and Gown which was
a notorious feature of Cambridge life even as late as
1850.  The eighteenth century in Cambridge actually
opened with a singularly unseemly fracas between
the Municipal and University authorities.  The Mayor
himself and two of the Aldermen were implicated.
The circumstances may be gathered from the "humble
submission" of the former, dated October 2, 1705, in
which he pleads guilty to having "denied unto Sir
John Ellys, the Vice-Chancellor, the precedence in
the joynt seat at the upper end of the guildhall
... which refusal was the occasion of a great deal of
contempt and indignity offered by some rude persons
to the said Vice-Chancellor and his attendants".  The
"submission" of Mr. Francis Perry and his colleague
followed in due course.  These gentlemen owned to
having opposed the Vice-Chancellor, "whereby divers
unworthy affronts and indignities were occasioned the
said Vice-Chancellor".  Their submission did not come
for the asking.  Till they were made, however, the
University authorities had "discommuned" half the
townsfolk: which meant that an undergraduate who
dared to deal with the burgesses might be sent
down, whilst a graduate, for the same conduct, might
be deprived of his degrees.  This jurisdiction is still
retained.
</p>

<p>
During this century sport became a prominent
and important feature of University life.  No longer
confined, as were the students of an earlier day, to
the precincts of the University, nor fenced about with
clerical rules aiming at an almost monkish propriety,
graduates and undergraduates began to ride, hunt,
and shoot over the countryside.  Towards the close
of the century the crowd of "persons of quality" who
attached themselves to the University as Noblemen
or Fellow Commoners necessarily included a number
of "raffish" spirits, who cared little for the convenience
of others.  A satirical advertisement touching this
question appeared in the <i>Cambridge Chronicle</i> for 30
August, 1787, in which the neighbouring farmers, after
announcing that their corn is in many places still
standing, "beg the favour of the Cambridge gunners,
coursers, and poachers, whether gentlemen, barbers,
or gyps of Colleges", to let them get home their
crops; and they continue: "If we might breed on
our own premises a bird or a hare for ourselves, and
have a day's shooting for our landlords, or our own
friends, we should acknowledge it a great indulgence
and politeness!"  But a good deal of miscellaneous
sport could be had within actual hail of the Colleges.
"In going over land now occupied by Downing Terrace,"
says Gunning, "you generally got five or six
shot at snipe.  Crossing the Leys you entered on
Cow Fen.  This abounded with snipes.  Walking
through the osier bed on the Trumpington side of
the brook you frequently met with a partridge and
now and then a pheasant."  But, for the
undergraduates and the juniors generally, there were
amusements enough.  Though expressly forbidden,
cockfighting was popular; and there were more gaming,
taverning, and the like diversions than sober-minded
persons could be expected to approve of.  Not only
the students, but the seniors fell into cliques or sets
each with its favourite coffee-house, where one
might peruse the news sheets, make a bet, or pick
a quarrel.  Clubs, for the most part of an avowedly
convivial nature, sprang into being, some of which,
like The True Blue, remain to this day.
</p>

<p>
With the seniors, horse-exercise and bowls were
popular pastimes.  The Cambridge bowling greens
were, and are, justly celebrated; and agreeable riding
was to be had in most directions out of Cambridge.
Along "The Backs" the mounting stones put up at
this time may still be seen.  Those Fellows of
Colleges who held livings or curacies just outside the
town rode to and from their cures in the performance
of their duties.  Other folk, like Dr. Samuel
Peck, rode daily to the town on matters of private
business.  It is recorded of this worthy member of
Trinity College that he gave advice on legal subjects
for nothing.  "Sam Peck never takes a fee," he would
say.  But he was wont to add that he saw no
objection to a "present" in return for his services.
Thus presents&mdash;mostly in kind&mdash;invariably followed
upon any disbursement of his legal knowledge.  The
figure of Sam Peck, mounted on his horse and loaded
with gifts, is preserved for us in a print now somewhat
scarce, but of which a copy hangs in the smaller
Combination Room at Trinity.  This charming picture
is also interesting as showing that for a celibate Fellow
of a College in those days the present of a pair of lady's
stays was not thought wholly unsuitable.  Fellows of
Colleges, it should be borne in mind, were by statute
debarred from matrimony; and, saving the case of
some few Civilians, i.e. graduates in Civil Law, they
were bound to take Holy Orders.  Thus were the
Universities filled with numbers of gentlemen who
in order to teach pagan literature on a comfortable
stipend, had been forced to assume the garb and too
often the duties of the Christian priesthood.  To give
them their due, however, they met the statutable
requirements of the place with a fortitude which never
sought to escape the gibes of those professed cynics
in which the age abounded; and there is surely a
healthy candour in the answer which a young Cambridge
clergyman returned to Mr. Gunning's congratulations
on his appointment to a convenient living.
"My predecessor," said he, "was a man of my own
age, but was providentially attacked with gout in
the stomach, and died before he could receive
medical attention."

The eighteenth century was pre-eminently an age
of oddities.  Just as people collected books, china,
and rare prints, so in a sense they collected men,
and delighted to record whatever was whimsical in
their fellow creatures.  The reminiscences of Henry
Gunning, sometime Esquire Bedell, teem with delightful
anecdotes.  To students of men and manners,
it is one of the best books in the language.  Its
comparative rarity must excuse the present writer for
drawing so largely upon it.  Of Gunning's recollections
of the seniors of his young days none are better than
his stories of Dr. Samuel Ogden.  Dr. Ogden took
his first degree as early as 1737, his D.D. in 1753,
and was appointed Professor of Geology in 1764.
Visitors to the Round Church may like to hear of
him, for there was he wont to preach.  He was
extremely fond of the pleasures of the table; and, while
it is not expressly stated of him, there seems good
cause to believe that like that fine old exciseman
immortalized by Hawthorne in his preface to <i>The
Scarlet Letter</i>, "there were flavours on his palate
which had lingered there not less than sixty years".
His was the saying: "A goose is a silly bird&mdash;too
much for one and too little for two".  At a dinner
party, on a dish of ruffs and reeves coming up very
much underdone, he answered his hostess's enquiry
as to their merit by observing, "They are admirable,
madam, <i>raw</i>!  What must they have been had they
been <i>roasted</i>?"  When dining at Wimpole with Lord
Hardwick, High Steward of the University, the butler,
in mistake for champagne&mdash;then a great rarity&mdash;handed
round glasses of pale brandy.  Lord Hardwick himself
instantly detected the error, but was too late to
prevent Dr. Ogden emptying his glass.  Lord Hardwick
could not suppress an exclamation of surprise.  "I
did not mention it to you, my lord," said Ogden,
"because I felt it my duty to take whatever you thought
fit to offer me, if not with pleasure, at least in silence."
</p>

<p>
It is a true saying that "where there be strange
folk there will be stranger doings", and the history of
Cambridge in the eighteenth century is charged with
accounts of the oddest happenings.  Could anything
be more extraordinary, for example, than the
circumstances which attended the election of Provost George
at King's College in January, 1743?  Twenty-two of
the Fellows were for George, sixteen for Thackeray,
and ten for Chapman, who was the Tory candidate.
A regular faction fight ensued.  The election was
bound by statute to take place in the Chapel, and
there the Fellows remained in conclave for thirty-one
hours.  Neither side would give way, and until they
had agreed on their man none were permitted to
stir out of the Chapel, "nor none permitted to enter",
says a historian in 1753.  An unsigned letter from
Cambridge, quoted by Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte in
his history of Eton College, gives a graphic account
of these incidents: "The Fellows went into Chapel
on Monday before noon in the morning as the statute
directs.  After prayer and sacraments they began
to vote....  A friend of mine, a curious man, tells
me he took a survey of his brothers at the hour of
two in the morning, and that never was a curious or
more diverting spectacle.  Some, wrapped in blankets,
erect in their stalls like mummies; others asleep on
cushions like so many gothic tombs; here a red cap
over a wig; there a face lost in the cape of a rug.
One blowing a chafing-dish with a surpliced sleeve;
another warming a little negus or sipping 'Coke
upon Littleton' i.e. tent and brandy.  Thus did they
combat the cold of that frosty night, which has not
killed many of them to my infinite surprise."  It is
worth noting this determination of the Fellows of
King's to act statutably, for the air was pretty full of
unstatutable proceedings afterwards.  It was apparently
as a protest against some irregularity of this kind
that one of the Scrutators (Mr. Tyrwhitt of Jesus)
refused his key to the Vice-Chancellor when that
dignitary desired to fix the University seal to a loyal
address to the Crown on the subject of the American
Rebellion.  Dr. Farmer, however, was not a man to
be baulked by trifles.  He obtained the services of a
blacksmith, and the seal was put to its appointed
purpose without further delay.

<p>
Dr. Farmer was Master of Emmanuel, and one
of the best known men of his time.  With Malone,
Reed, and Steevens he formed a coterie which was
known in Cambridge as "the Shakespeare gang".
Farmer knew the Elizabethans by heart, and he made
Emmanuel Parlour, as the Combination Room of the
College was then called, a centre of literary
table-talk.  His was an amiable personality.  Though a
strong Tory, he never allowed political bias to impair
his friendships.  "This is a Whig pipe, Master
Gunning," he would say, with a sly twinkle.  "It has a
twist the wrong way."  It was in Emmanuel Parlour
that Dr. Johnson made one of his best sallies.  The
story is told by Isaac Reed, who was present.
Someone asked why county squires should be addicted to
rural sport above everything else.  "Sir," said
Dr. Johnson, "I have found out the reason of it, and
the reason is that they feel the vacuity which is in
them less when they are in motion than when they
are at rest."  It was during Dr. Farmer's mastership
that Emmanuel celebrated the two hundredth anniversary
of its foundation.  For some days before the
actual feast which was to take place in honour of
the occasion, the inhabitants of the College were
delighted with the spectacle of several "lively turtles"
disporting themselves in tubs of water.  William Pitt
and the Earl of Euston, then the Members of Parliament
for the University, were present at the banquet.
The convivialities were kept up in the Parlour till a
very late hour.  Here Dr. Randall, the Professor of
Music, "was called upon for his celebrated song in
the character of a drunken man.  The representation
was so faithfully given that Mr. Pitt was completely
deceived, and expressed some anxiety lest the worthy
professor should meet with an accident when leaving
the College."
</p>

<p>
But good Dr. Farmer was never more in his element
than when sitting in what was called "the
Critics' Row" at the Playhouse specially set up
during the weeks in which Stourbridge Fair held the
attention of the three counties.  Mention has already
been made of this celebrated Fair.  During the
eighteenth century it was by far the largest Fair in the
country.  Every trade was represented, and here many
of the good folk of Cambridgeshire, Huntingdon, and
the Isle of Ely made the principal part of their
household purchases for the year.  People came from
London and elsewhere to be present at the opening
festivities.  The declaration of the Fair was a
matter of University as well as civic ceremonial.  The
Vice-Chancellor and the other University officers,
attended by the noblemen and other notables, drove to
the Fair, which was duly proclaimed by the Registrary
of the University.  The Senior Proctor provided cakes
and wine at the Senate House before starting.  To
the University dignitaries and their guests was set
apart a certain Tiled Booth, where they dined.  The
menu at the Vice-Chancellor's table never varied.  It
consisted of a large dish of herrings, a neck of pork
roasted, a plum pudding, a leg of pork boiled, a pease
pudding, a goose, and a huge apple pie, while a round
of beef graced the centre of the board.  Before the end
of the century this dinner had degenerated into a sort
of oyster luncheon.  During this and the Midsummer
or "Pot" Fair there was a deal of drunken and
riotous behaviour not confined, alas! to the townsfolk
or the peasant classes.  It is reported that tipsy
Masters of Arts, many Fellows of Colleges, and clergymen
were to be seen with linked arms jostling the
passers-by.
</p>

<p>
To read but this side of University history one
might suppose an academy in which such things were
possible would hardly be able to claim to have done
much for learning during this period.  But Cambridge
was no worse as a school for manners than was
any other place of education at this time; while the
period is one to which we look back to-day as the
age of Newton, Bentley, and Person,&mdash;names which
alone are sufficient to raise the University into the
first place as a seat of learning.  The poets, Prior,
Gray, Coleridge, and Wordsworth had their
education in Cambridge before the century closed.  So
also did Laurence Sterne.  Halifax, the two
Walpoles, Lord Camden, Lord Chesterfield, Lord
Ellenborough, Lord Bathurst, Lord Thurloe, Pitt the
younger, Castlereagh, Wilberforce, Denman were
some of the illustrious Cambridge men who found
places in the great world of that day; while Paley
and Charles Simeon were prominent in the religious
life of the time.
</p>

<p>
Many buildings of importance, all designed in
good taste, grew up in Cambridge during this century.
The library of Samuel Pepys, including the manuscript
of his celebrated <i>Diary</i>, was left to his old
College of Magdalene in 1703, and reached Cambridge
in 1725, when it was placed in what are now called
the Fellows' buildings, a range built to do honour
to the bequest.  To the University Library, enriched
by King George I's present of Bishop Moore's
collection, was added a new wing designed in the
Classical style.  The Senate House as we now see it
is an eighteenth-century building, and a fine example
of its period.  At King's College the Fellows'
building by Gibbs is another notable addition to the
architecture of the place, and the alterations at Clare,
Trinity Hall, and Emmanuel are all good of their
kind.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of Cambridge does not consist in broad
streets or in imposing public buildings.  The greater
Colleges lie with their gatehouses towards the town,
their courts and lawns stretching towards the river,
which is spanned by their private bridges.  Beyond
the river the eye is charmed with a vista of tall trees
and flowery gardens.  In every College there lurk
particular treasures.  Corpus Christi, with its old Court
abutting on the Saxon Church of St. Benet, where in
bygone days the scholars were wont to worship, can
show the hall in which Kit Marlowe dined and
Parker presided.  This College has one of the most
interesting libraries in the University, and one of the
best collections of plate in the country.  Jesus College
has an unique chapel.  Norman and Early English
masonry, fine old stalls, and a mediæval organ may
here be seen, and, for those who care for such things,
there are windows by Morris and Burne-Jones.
Examples of Wren's work in Cambridge have already
been noticed.  The bridge built from his designs at
St. John's is illustrated in the present volume.  No
one should miss all there is to see in this stately
College.  The Combination Room is a typical Tudor
gallery; and on Feast Nights, when illuminated with
wax candles in silver sconces, it presents a picture
unforgetably beautiful.  Trinity and St. John's are the
only Colleges possessed of statuary.  In the anti-chapel
of the former College the statues of Newton,
Bacon, Barrow, Macaulay, Whewell, and Tennyson
form a striking group.  That of Newton is by Roubiliac,
and some busts by this admirable master may be
seen in the College library, where too is the celebrated
statue of Byron by Thorwaldsen, and numerous
enrichments of the bookcases by the hand of Grinling
Gibbons.  This library, which is one of the principal
Collegiate libraries in Europe, has over 100,000 volumes.
Among its manuscripts are the celebrated Canterbury
Psalter, a volume of Milton manuscripts (including
the first sketch of <i>Paradise Lost</i>), the manuscript of
Tennyson's <i>In Memoriam</i>, that of Thackeray's
<i>Esmond</i>, and several Byron manuscripts.  The library
of St. John's College is second only to that at Trinity.
It is approached by a staircase of singular beauty.  At
Magdalene is the Pepys Library; and the libraries of
Peterhouse, Trinity Hall, and Queens' are good specimens
of mediæval college collections.  The University
has two public libraries.  Of these the University
Library proper enjoys the right to a copy of every
book printed in the realm.  It numbers some 500,000
volumes, and is rich in every kind of literature.  The
rule which allows M.A.'s and certain B.A.'s to borrow
books, and which gives readers access to the shelves,
makes this library, as Lord Acton said, "the only useful
library in Europe".  The library of the Fitzwilliam
Museum includes a remarkable collection of musical
manuscripts, the most valuable of which are
manuscripts of Bach, Handel, and Beethoven.
</p>

<p>
During the last hundred years Cambridge has been
enriched with numerous laboratories and several
collegiate institutions.  Of the latter the most important
is Downing College, built in 1805.  Two professors have
their maintenance here: one of Medicine, the other of
the Laws of England.  On Downing property the
present Law Schools, Geological Museum, and other
of the more recent habitations of science have been
built.  The great Cavendish Laboratory, to which the
seventh Duke of Devonshire was a conspicuous
benefactor, was built in 1874.  Almost every branch of
science now possesses its special museum, while
art and the study of antiquities are served by the
Fitzwilliam and the Archæological Museums.
</p>

<p>
Cambridge to-day is a large and complex
community: the undergraduate population alone has
reached nearly four thousand souls.  The Senate, or
body of M.A.'s having voting powers in the government
of the University, numbers over seven thousand
persons; while the total number of members of the
University who still keep their names "on the boards"
stands at 14,758.  Every kind of study, from astral
chemistry to engineering, finds among this mass of
people some professed teachers and eager students.
</p>

All this has not been a matter of natural growth.
The nineteenth century saw far-reaching changes
imposed upon the University; though for some time,
most Fellows of Colleges were still required to take
Orders, and the rule of celibacy was enforced.  By
the removal of these restrictions and by the abolition
of Religious Tests, the University has reaped much
benefit.  But it has not been all gain.  The amenities
of College life in many of the smaller societies have
been considerably interfered with, and that "corporate
sense" which has hitherto been the strength of the
college system has been weakened.  On the other
hand, the additions which have been made to the
recognized fields of intellectual activity have indisputably
made for the utility of Cambridge as a centre of
education; though it is possible that the demand for
young teachers, both public and private, by drawing
men away from private study, may tend to lessen the
value of the University as a contemplative body.  Of
this danger not everyone seems unconscious.

As the seventeenth century was the age of Bacon,
and the eighteenth century that of Newton, so the
nineteenth century has been called the age of
Darwin.  Thus has Cambridge sent three of her sons to
revolutionize the study of Natural Philosophy.  Among
Cambridge scientists of modern times are Adams,
Airy, Herschell, Clarke-Maxwell, Stokes, Lords
Kelvin, Rayleigh, Avebury, Sir James Dewar, and Sir
Joseph Thompson.  Cambridge as a school of medicine
has been celebrated ever since the time of Caius.
Its importance at the present moment is largely owing
to the life and labour of the late Sir Michael Foster.
Numerous Cambridge men have held professorships
at Oxford during the century.  The names of Maine,
Sir F. Pollock, and Mr. Sidgwick at once occur to
the mind; and to-day the chairs of Astronomy,
Physics, Botany, Classical Archæology, and English
Literature in that University are occupied by
Cambridge men.  From Cambridge, too, come the
Astronomer Royal, his immediate predecessor, and
most of the provincial and colonial astronomers.

Popular fallacies die hard.  But it is indeed
remarkable that Cambridge should be supposed to give
herself over to mathematical studies, when it is
remembered that she produced in Bentley and Person
the two greatest classics that England ever knew;
while in the nineteenth century Munro, Jebb, and
Headlam have won European reputations as classical
scholars; and, of the older Universities, Cambridge
alone confers a purely classical degree.  The
Cambridge School of Theology is associated with the
names of Westcott, Lightfoot, and Hort.

Modern Cambridge has been prolific in men of
letters: Byron, Macaulay, Thackeray, Kinglake,
Tennyson, Fitzgerald, Grote, Kingsley, Seely,
F. D. Maurice, Samuel Butler, Leslie Stephen, and Maitland
are names taken at random.  The list of her public
men is a long one and includes the great Whig peers
from Palmerston, Melbourne, Grey, and Lansdowne
to such men as the late Duke of Devonshire and the
late Earl Spencer: the senior branch of the House
of Cecil has been uniformly faithful to Cambridge since
the days of the great Lord Burleigh.  The Manners
family have been as stoutly Cambridge; and the late
Duke of Rutland, better known as Lord John Manners,
was a familiar figure in the University.  It is
a Cambridge College that can claim at this moment
the Speaker, the Lord Chief Justice, the Leader of
the House of Lords, the Leader of the Opposition in
the Commons, the Viceroy of India, the Ex-Viceroy,
and the retiring Governor-General of Canada.

Cambridge as a home of legal studies has been
famous since the sixteenth century: Lyndhurst,
Cranworth, Pollock, Fitzjames Stephen are legal
luminaries of modern times.  Trinity Hall is the College
with which the study of law is particularly associated.
For two hundred years this College practically
controlled the Court of Arches, which until the nineteenth
century was some way advanced took cognizance of
all Probate and Admiralty cases, as well as of causes
arising out of ecclesiastical jurisdictions.  For some
time the Masters and Fellows appointed the Dean
of Arches, and the Master enjoyed a right to rooms
in Doctors' Commons.  Among learned Civilians who
have presided over the destinies of "the Hall" are
Sir James Exton, Sir Nathaniel Lloyd, Sir Edward
Simpson, and Sir William Wynne.  The last of this
order (for the Court of Arches lost its civil
jurisdiction at this time) was Sir Herbert Jenner Fust,
whose name will long be remembered in connection
with the celebrated Gorham judgment.  Sir
Herbert was succeeded in the Mastership by the
late Sir Henry Summer Maine, of Pembroke College,
sometime Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence at
Oxford.

The reputation of a College for this or that study
is, however, less precious to its more thoughtful
inmates than are those associations with famous men
long since dead which cling to every grove and
every court in Cambridge: to Byron's pool at
Grantchester; to Milton's mulberry tree in the Fellows'
garden at Christ's; to the little tower at Queens' in
which Erasmus studied; to the rooms occupied by
Gray at Pembroke; to Newton's at Trinity; or to
Wordsworth's at St. John's.  Sometimes such
traditions are well founded; but if they be not, what
matter?  The strength and value of such things lie
in their power to cause even the youngest of us to
see humanity as a grave pageant, of which we may
be witnesses though only for a space.  But membership
of an English University carries with it experiences
more personal and more intimate than these.
A man may deem himself to be bestowing scant
notice upon his surroundings, and yet there are a
hundred impressions made upon him by sights and
sounds, in these his student days, which pass
pattern-wise into the fabric of his nature.  Other phases of
College life are remembered in more detail: hours
passed in anxious study for the schools; boisterous
gatherings when, with old wine in young bellies, almost
anything seemed worth the saying; eager struggles
in the field or upon the river, when the glory of the
College really did seem to depend upon the muscles
of some eight or fifteen carefully-dieted young men.
One recalls these states of mind as facts; but they
have no corresponding values in the world of sense.
The really haunting memories are those of particular
firesides; of the outlook from this or that window
seat; of a moonlit court in summer-time, of the scent
of flowers there and of the babble of the fountain;
of choir music by taper light in winter; and of the
ordered chimes leisurely perpetuating their Tudor
cadences.  Such thoughts, such recollections
